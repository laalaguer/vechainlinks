# Development History

## Milestone #1: Build a Simple Static Website

Target: Collect Links inside VeChain eco-system.
- Medium
- Twitter
- Reddit
- Weibo
- Official Sites
- Standalone Media Sites
- Useful Tools.
- Telegram Channels
- Codes: VeChain
- Documentation for developers.
- Dapps URLs, Dapps Githubs

Result:
- [x] A simple working static site.
- [x] 5 users to comment about the website.
- [x] Open for public members to contribute.

## Milestone #2: Make the Website Dynamic

Apart from above "static" goals, build a "scraper" or "reporter" system, that automatically gathers information from Twitter/Medium/Reddit/Github to show "progress" of the VeChain.

Target #1:
- { Reddit, Medium, WP } Feeds -- RSS can be obtained directly.
- { Twitter, Weibo } Feeds. -- RSS can be obtained from 3rd party.
- { Website } - simple hash-then-cache scrapper bot.
- { Telegram, Github } - Need to develop ourselves.
- Standardize the "social media" backend and output a single RSS API: {bot_type:, user_identifier:, newest:, previous_cache:}
- Cache the RSS result, server fetch from source every X minutes.

Problem Solving:

Reddit: [Atom-1.0]

We output feeds with RSS-2.0 styleã€‚

Target #2:
- A Dynamic frontend to display Feeds (excerpt)
- The frontend should be fully static (many data rendered beforehand)
- A Dynamic Backend to collect RSS and serve API.
- Use a simple package manager to automate the build process.

- [x] Get 20 users to comment about the website.
