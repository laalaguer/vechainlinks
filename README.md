# Vechain Links - Show me interesting subjects in VeChain!

## Step One: Build a Static Website

Links to:

- Medium:
- Twitter:
- Reddit:
- Weibo:
- Official Sites: 
- Standalone Media/Tools Sites:
- Telegram Channels:
- Codes: VeChain OrganizationiOS, Android
- Tools: Desktop, 
- Dapps URLs, Dapps Githubs, perosnal projects

## Step Two: Build a Dynamic Website

Apart from above "static" goals, we need some "scraper" or "reporter" system, that automatically gathers information from Twitter/Medium/Reddit/Github to show "progress" of the VeChain.

- When are the resources updated?
- What content is updated? Anything new?
- 

As well as other hashtags or mentions from other channels:
- Cointelegraph:
- CoinDesk:
- OceanEx:


## Step Three: Automate build process, let the public members contribute

Let the source code can be submitted by an outsider. And once improved, can be automatically built into an image, then mounted on on the main website.

- A contributor makes a change.
- PR review and merge by the maintainer.
- Auto check and build zip by Travis.
- Unzip and deploy on server. - auto?
