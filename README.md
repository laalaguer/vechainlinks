## Milestone #2: Make the Website Dynamic

Apart from above "static" goals, build a "scraper" or "reporter" system, that automatically gathers information from Twitter/Medium/Reddit/Github to show "progress" of the VeChain.

Target #1:
- { Reddit, Medium, WP } Feeds -- RSS can be obtained directly.
- { Twitter, Weibo } Feeds. -- RSS can be obtained from 3rd party.
